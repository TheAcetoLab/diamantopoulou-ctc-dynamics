## Publication

Diamantopoulou, Z., Castro-Giner, F., Schwab F.D., Foerster C., Saini, M., Budinjas, S., Strittmatter, K., Krol, I., Seifert, B., Heinzelmann-Schwarz, V., Kurzeder, C., Rochlitz, C., Vetter, M., Weber, W.P., & Aceto N.

## Abstract

We isolated live circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a breast cancer patient (number of CTCs = 36) and two breast cancer xenografts, NSG-CDX-BR16 (number of CTCs = 138) and NSG-LM2 (number of CTCs = 108) at different time points. Isolated CTCs were categorized into three different types : single CTC, CTC clusters and CTC-white blood cells (CTC-WBC) clusters. Amplified cDNA was prepared according to the Smart-seq2 protocol. Libraries were prepared using with Nextera XT (Illumina) and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq500 instrument in 75-bp single-read mode.


## Data pre-processing

Raw data is available at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, NCBI; accession number [GSE180097](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE180097)). Data processing is computationally expensive and is not covered in this repository. We provide description of the data pre-processing workflow together with software version in the original publication. Processed data, large result files, additional functions, references and metadata are were archived at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6358987.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6358987)


##  Data and code availability

To reproduce our analysis, first clone source code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheAcetoLab/diamantopoulou-ctc-dynamics). This repository is also archived at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6484917.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6484917)

    git clone https://github.com/TheAcetoLab/diamantopoulou-ctc-dynamics.git

Next, download processed data deposited in [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6358987) into the cloned project folder ./data directory and untar the files.

    for file in *.tar.gz; do tar xzvf "${file}" && rm "${file}"; done

## Reproducibility

The results form our analyses are listed below in webpage format. They were generated from R Markdown documents deposited in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheAcetoLab/diamantopoulou-ctc-dynamics). The workflow of the analysis was created using the [workflowr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/workflowr/index.html) R package and can be reproduced in its totality using [workflowr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/workflowr/index.html) [wflow_build](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowrBeta/reference/wflow_build.html) command after the installation of the proper R-packages. Session info, including R and package versions, was automatically included at the end of each analysis file.

Files containing pre-computed results from differential expression or gene-set enrichment analyses were deposited in [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6358987.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6358987). In order to generate those files again change the option `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE` in the specific code chunk from the R Markdown file.
