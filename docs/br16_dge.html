Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/TheAcetoLab/diamantopoulou-ctc-dynamics/tree/2b5d5c2cbb2297240a3c5076e6759b69bad10c2a" target="_blank">2b5d5c2</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were
made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/br16_dge.Rmd</code>) and HTML

<h2>Correlation DEG single CTC versus CTC clusters and CTC-WBC</h2>
<p>Scatter plot showing the correlation of the fold-change between
active and rest phase in single CTC (Y-axis) versus CTC clusters and
CTC-WBC (X-axis), using genes with FDR ≤ 0.05 in any of the two sets
(two-sided Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0.57, P value ≤ 2.22e-16).
Points are colored according to the dataset where they were found with a
FDR ≤ 0.05 (both, single CTC or CTC clusters and CTC-WBC clusters). The
dashed red line represents the linear regression line using all the
points in the plot.</p>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
