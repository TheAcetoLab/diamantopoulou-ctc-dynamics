Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/TheAcetoLab/diamantopoulou-ctc-dynamics/tree/c6ab8b0d0ea1510633ea1ac17096ffb41718009b" target="_blank">c6ab8b0</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>

Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

The F statistic and the corresponding P value combine the pair-wise comparisons between all the time points in the experiment with more than three replicates. GSVA scores for each individual sample are listed at the end of the table.<\/caption>","data":[["REACTOME_SRP_DEPENDENT_COTRANSLATIONAL_PROTEIN_TARGETING_TO_MEMBRANE","REACTOME_RESPONSE_OF_EIF2AK4_GCN2_TO_AMINO_ACID_DEFICIENCY","WP_CYTOPLASMIC_RIBOSOMAL_PROTEINS","REACTOME_EUKARYOTIC_TRANSLATION_ELONGATION","KEGG_RIBOSOME","GOBP_REGULATION_OF_CELL_CYCLE_G2_M_PHASE_TRANSITION","GOBP_CELL_DIVISION","PID_AURORA_B_PATHWAY","GOBP_NUCLEAR_CHROMOSOME_SEGREGATION","GOBP_CHROMOSOME_SEGREGATION","GOBP_SISTER_CHROMATID_SEGREGATION","GOBP_MITOTIC_SISTER_CHROMATID_SEGREGATION","GOBP_MITOTIC_NUCLEAR_DIVISION","GOBP_ORGANELLE_FISSION","REACTOME_M_PHASE","REACTOME_CELL_CYCLE_MITOTIC","REACTOME_MITOTIC_METAPHASE_AND_ANAPHASE","REACTOME_SEPARATION_OF_SISTER_CHROMATIDS","REACTOME_CELL_CYCLE_CHECKPOINTS","REACTOME_MITOTIC_PROMETAPHASE","REACTOME_MITOTIC_SPINDLE_CHECKPOINT","REACTOME_RESOLUTION_OF_SISTER_CHROMATID_COHESION"],["Translation","Translation","Translation","Translation","Translation","Cell

<h3>GSVA across time series</h3>
<p>GSVA score for translation (yellow, n= 5) and cell division (blue, n=
17) gene sets in CTCs obtained from the NSG-LM2 time-kinetics

<h3>Average GSVA score across time series</h3>
<p>Average GSVA score for translation (yellow, n=5) and cell division
(blue, n=17) gene sets in CTCs obtained in the NSG-LM2 time-kinetics
experiment. The average was calculated for each gene set and time point
across all CTC samples (ZT0 n=1, ZT4 n=9, ZT12 n=6, ZT16 n=3, ZT20 n=5).
The white and grey backgrounds represent environmental light (rest
period) and dark conditions (active period), respectively.</p>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
